# Rereact

This is a React clone built using only vanilla JS. The React clone is then used to build a presentational site explaining how the React clone works.

**Bonus**: React clone has 1 extra special feature that extends React.

## MVP Goals

* Create virtual DOM
* Render virtual DOM onto the real DOM
* Class components
* State management
* Re-render *entire* virtual DOM when state changes (easier but inefficient)

## Stretch Goals

* Re-render *specific parts* of virtual DOM that are actually affected by state changes
* Functional components
* Props
* Class names for components for targeted styling
* Lifecycle methods
